## Overview
Shithead is a popular card game, played with a standard deck of 52 playing cards, typically for 2-5 players.

Many variations of the game exist, but the Sainsbury's Winnersh ruleset is the one, true version of the game. All other versions are incorrect and should not be indulged.

The Sainsbury's Winnersh rules were carefully refined over many, many rounds, primarily at the Pheasant pub in Winnersh, UK, circa 2001-2003.

## Object of the game
There are no winners in Shithead, just one loser, "The Shithead".
Players aim to lose all of their cards, thus leaving the game and avoiding becoming the Shithead. The last player still holding cards is the Shithead. You do not want to be the Shithead.

## Setup
One player shuffles and deals, distributing starting cards to the players. For subsequent rounds, the position of dealer rotates one person to the left.

Cards are distributed one at a time, clockwise, starting with the player to the dealer's left.

Each player is allocated nine starting cards, like so:

* Three "down" cards, which remain face down initially and are unknown even to the player receiving them. These are arranged in a line in front of the player.
* Three "up" cards, which are distributed face up and visible to all players. Each of these is placed upon one of the player's down card cards, so that each down card is covered by precisely one up card.
* Three "hand" cards, which are held in the player"s hand, visible only to them and not the other players.

The remaining cards form a face-down pick up pile on the table.

Before the game begins, and _only_ before the game begins, players may choose to exchange some or all of their hand cards with some or all of their own up cards. Players will typically do this to ensure their better cards are in the "up" position, which will hopefully leave them in a stronger position towards the end of a game.
## Gameplay

The game is turn-based: Each player takes their turn, then play moves clockwise. The game continues in this fashion until all but one players have been eliminated, at which point the game ends and the last remaining player is declared "The Shithead".

The general idea is that a player must play a card that has face value equal to or higher than the previous card played.

A player's _must_ perform one of three actions on their turn:

1. Play one or more "playable" cards from their hand, adding it/them to the active play pile
2. Pick up the active play pile
3. "Show" a 3 to another player (more details on this later on).

A player might not be able to go, in which case they must pick up the active play pile (which could be empty, if they are lucky), incorporating those cards into their hand. They do not need to reveal any cards from their hand while picking up.

A player might tactically choose to pick up the pile rather than take another action, even if they had a playable card in their hand.

Certain events permit the player to an immediate second go (more details on this later on).

If a player gets rid of their last card in an action that would have otherwise resulted in them taking an immediate futher turn, the player to their left instead takes the next turn (unless they are the last remaining player, in which case the game is over and they are the shithead).

## Playable cards

A playable card is a card in the player's hand that has face value equal to or higher than the previous card played, with two exceptions:

* A 2 is playable after any card of any value
* If the previous card played was a 7, then the next card played must be equal to or _lower_. i.e. 2, 4, 5, 6 or 7 (3 is purposefully absent and will be discussed subsequently).

Aces are always high.

## Playing a 2
A 2 can be played after any prior card and permits the player a second go immediately. Since 2 is the lowest face value card, any other card is subsequently playable. This is a highly useful card as it effectively acts as a reset. 

## Burning cards
If a player plays a 10, the active play pile is "burned". Those cards, including the 10, are removed from play to a "burn pile". Those cards are not used any further for that game.

The active play pile is also burned if all four cards of a particular face value are played consecutively. 

In both cases, the player whose card initiated the burn gets another go. If that player is now out of the game, the player to their left takes the next go, starting with any card of their choosing.

## Playing multiple cards 

If a player holds more than one card with the same face value in their hand, and they are playable cards, a player may play two or more of them at once, if they do choose. This is a handy mechanism for getting rid of one's cards as quickly as possible. It is also often used to trigger a burn where four of kind are played at the same time. However it might be advantageous to avoid this with stronger cards.

## Starting the game

The only time the suit of a card matters in Shithead is when starting the game. If a player has the four of clubs in their hand, they declare this and play it to start the game.

If no player has the four of clubs in hand, the four of spades would be the next starting card, then hearts, then diamonds, then the five of clubs, and so on.

## Minimum hand size
A player's hand has no upper limit.

If a player plays one or more cards, and this reduces their hand size to below three cards, and there are still cards in the pickup pile, they must replenish their hand using the top card(s) from the pick up pile - as many as it takes to either return their hand size to three or fully exhaust the pickup pile, whichever comes first.

## Showing 3s

Threes are never played like other cards.

Instead of playing cards or picking up the pile, a player with a 3 in their hand may "show" one or more or them to another player, a physical gesture where they hold the card to a particular opponent.

The recipient of the 3 must pick up the active play pile. The player to their left then takes the next turn. For this reason, it is common to show 3s to the player to your right, so that you then take the next turn as well.

If a player is shown a 3, but they also hold a 3 in their hand, they may respond to the 3 with their 3, forcing the original player to pickup instead (a "backfire"). 

3s are single-use and are always burned afterwards.

If a player has recently left the game by exhausting all their cards, they can be "shown" back into the game by a 3 so long as play has not gone a full rotation since their exit. So one the player who was to their right has completed their next turn, then there is no further danger of being shown back in, you can get up and go to the bar.
## Endgame - "up" cards

One a player has exhausted their hand cards, they can begin to play their up cards, choosing any of the remaining up cards on their turn.

At the point of their next turn, one of these cards, at the player's choosing enters their hand. If they can play, and choose to play, it then leaves their hand immediately. If they cannot play, it remains in their hand, alongside any cards they pick up as a result of not having a playable card.

When a player plays their last hand card(s), if they have up card with the same face value, those cards may akso be played that turn (e.g. a jack in the hand and a jack up card could be played as a pair).

## Endgame - "down" card

Once a player has exhausted their hand cards and up cards, they must play one of their downwards blindly.

They may choose to preselect and view this card prior to their next turn (once hand and up cards are exhausted), at which point the card enters their hand. They may not change that decision once the card has been viewed.

If shown a three at the point with no hand cards and no up cards, one of the down cards may be taken into the hand along with any pickup cards.

Since the down card becomes a hand card prior to being played, there is no need to reveal the card if it cannot be played on the player's next turn, it simply remains in the hand.
## Libraries

An excessively large hand (10+ cards ) is a "library". If a player picks up a large amount of cards, giving them a library, all other players must sing "Library Boy" at this player, to the tune if "Wonderboy" by Tenacious D.

## Losing thrice in a sitting

If a player loses three games in a sitting (consecutive or otherwise), all other players must sing "Once, Twice, Three Times A Shithead", to the tune of "Three Times A Lady" by The Commodores.
