## 1. Overview

Shithead is a popular card game, played with a standard deck of 52 playing cards, typically for 2-5 players.

Many variations of the game exist, but the Winnersh ruleset is the one, true version of the game. All other versions are incorrect and should not be indulged.

The Winnersh rules were carefully refined over many, many rounds, primarily at the Pheasant pub in Winnersh, UK, circa 2001-2003.

## 2. Object of the game

There are no winners in Shithead, only one loser, "The Shithead".
Players aim to lose all of their cards, allowing them to leave the game and thus avoiding becoming the Shithead.

The last player still holding cards loses the game, and is the Shithead. You do not want to be the Shithead.

## 3. Setup

One player shuffles and deals, distributing starting cards to each player, including themselves. Players are trusted as a group to be able to amicably establish who deals first. For subsequent rounds, the position of dealer rotates one person to the left.

Cards are distributed one at a time, clockwise, starting with the player to the dealer's left.

Each player is allocated nine starting cards, like so:

- Three "down" cards, (the first to be dealt) which are dealt and remain face down, unknown even to the player receiving them. These are arranged in a line in front of the player.
- Three "up" cards, which are distributed face up and visible to all players. Each of these is placed upon one of the player's down-cards, so that each down-card is covered by precisely one up-card.
- Three "hand" cards (the last to be dealt), which are dealt face down and held in the player's hand, visible only to them.

The remaining cards form a face-down pick-up pile in the centre of the playing area.

Space should be left in the playing area for a "play pile" and a "burn pile".

_Example of set-up for a four-player game_

Before the game begins, and _only_ before the game begins, players may choose to exchange some or all of their hand-cards with some or all of their up-cards. Players will typically do this to ensure their better cards are in the "up" position, which will hopefully leave them in a stronger position towards the end of a game.

```
      Player 1
      --------
Hand: 5 2 K           5 8 9
Up:   9 K 8     --->  K K 2
Down: ? ? ?           ? ? ?
```

## 4. Gameplay

The game is turn-based: The first player takes their turn, then play moves clockwise to that player's left, they take their turn, and so on.

### 4.1 Starting the game

The player with the weakest card in their hand takes the first turn. The weakest face-value in Shithead is 4. If no players hold a 4 then a player holding a 5 will take the first turn, then 6, and so on.

In the event that two or more players both have the joint-weakest card in their hand, then the suit of the card will decide which player goes first. This is the only time that the suit of a card has any influence on gameplay. The suit preference order is as follows:

1. Clubs (So a player holding the 4 of Clubs would always know they are playing first)
2. Spades
3. Diamonds
4. Hearts

### 4.2 Ending the game

When a player has no more cards left, they have left the game. When only one player remains, the game is over, and that player is The Shithead.

### 4.3 A player's turn

A player must perform precisely one of three actions on their turn:

1. Play a set of _playable_ cards from their hand, adding it/them face up onto the top of the play pile
2. Pick up all of the play pile cards into their hand
3. "Show" a 3 to another player (more details on this later - see section 9).

If a player has no playable cards, and no 3s to show, then their only option is to pick up the play pile (which could be empty, if they are lucky), incorporating those cards into their hand. They do not need to reveal any cards from their hand while picking up.

A player might tactically choose to pick up the pile rather than take another action, even if they had a playable card in their hand.

When a player picks up the pile, the player to their left takes the next turn, playing any card of their choosing.

Certain actions permit the player an immediate, additional turn. If a player gets rid of their last card in an action that would have otherwise resulted in them taking an immediate, additional turn, then the player to their left instead takes the next turn (unless they are the sole, remaining player, in which case the game is over).

#### 4.3.1 Minimum hand size

If a player plays one or more cards on their turn, and this reduces their hand size to below three cards, and if there are still cards in the pick-up pile, they must replenish their hand using the top card(s) from the pick-up pile - as many as it takes to either return their hand size to three or fully exhaust the pick-up pile, whichever comes first.

There is no upper limit to the number of cards in a player's hand, other than the size of the deck.

If a player played a card from their hand, entitling them to another go, taking their hand-size below three, and if the pick-up pile is not empty, then they would pick up-cards to replenish their hand before taking the additional go.

```
Example:
Player 1 has five cards in-hand: a 4, a 5, and three Jacks.
They are able to play their three Jacks as a set, reducing their hand size to two cards.
Since the pick-up pile is not empty, they take the top card from the pick-up pile into their hand, bringing their hand-size up to the minimum of three.

Example:
Player 2 has three cards in-hand: a 10 and two 5s.
There is only one card left in the pick-up pile.
They are able to play their 5s as a pair, reducing their hand size to one card. They pick up the final card in the pick-up pile into their hand. Their hand size is now two cards, since it is not possible to replenish it back to three cards.
```

## 5. Playable cards

A playable card is a card in the player's hand that has face value equal to or higher than the card at the top of the play pile (i.e. the last card played), with two exceptions:

- A 2 is playable after any card of any value (see section 7)
- If the previous card played was a 7, then the next card played must be equal to or _lower_. i.e. 2, 4, 5, 6 or 7 (3 is purposefully absent since 3's are never _played_, they are _shown_).

Aces are always high, and so the only cards that can be played after an Ace are another Ace, or a 2.

If there is no card at the top of the play pile - e.g. because it's the first turn of the game, or the last player had to pick up the play pile, then any card (except a 3) is a playable card.

Note that despite the special property of the 7 card, it must still be played in sequence, and can only be played after cards with equal or lower value.

```
Example:
Player 2 plays an 8.
Play moves to Player 3, who has a hand of 4, 8 and Jack.
The 4 is not playable, as it has lower face-value than the last played card.
The 8 is playable, as it has equal face-value to the last played card.
The Jack is playable, as it has greater face-value than the last played card.
```

## 6. Playing multiple cards

Typically a player may only play one playable card on their turn - a set of one playable cards.

If a player holds more than one playable card with the same face value in their hand, they may play two or more of them at once, in a single turn - a set of multiple playable cards. This is a handy mechanism for getting rid of one's cards as quickly as possible, although it might be advantageous to avoid this with stronger cards.

```
Example:
Player 2 plays an 8.
Play moves to Player 3, who has a hand of 4, and two 9s.
They are able to play both 9s together, as a set.
```

## 7. Playing a 2

A 2 can be played after any prior card and permits the player a second go immediately. Since 2 is the lowest face value card, any other card is subsequently playable. This is a highly useful card as it effectively acts as a reset.

If playing the 2 reduces the player's hand size to below three cards, and if the pick-up pile is not empty, the player should replenish their hand from the pick-up pile before taking their next turn.

```
Example:
Player 2 plays an Ace.
Play moves to Player 3, who has a hand of 4, 5 and 2.
They are able to play the 2.
They then pick-up a 9 to replenish their hand.
They may now play any of the 4, 5 or 9 in their hand.
```

## 8. Burning cards

If a player plays a 10, the play pile is "burned". Those cards, including the 10 (or 10s), are removed from play to the "burn pile". Burnt cards take no further part in the current game.

Note that despite the 10 having this special power, it is still bound by the regular gameplay rules, and must be played in sequence - i.e. it cannot be played after higher-value cards.

The play pile is also burned if all four cards of a particular face value are played consecutively (whether by a single player or by consecutive players).

In both cases, the player whose card initiated the burn gets another go.

```
Example:
Player 3 plays a 9.
Player 4 has a hand of four cards, including a 10.
Player 4 plays the 10, burning the play pile, moving all of those cards to the burn pile.
They do not pick-up new cards into their hand since their hand is still three cards or more in size (exactly three cards).
They take an additional go, playing any of the remaining three cards in their hand, since the play pile is empty.
They end their turn by picking up a card from the pick-up pile, to replenish their hand back to three cards.

Example:
Player 4 plays two Kings.
Player 1, the next player, has the other two Kings in their hand.
They play these two Kings, making four consecutive Kings, burning the play pile.
Player 1 replenishes their hand if required, and takes another go.

Example:
Player 1 plays two Kings.
Player 2 plays an Ace.
Player 3 plays a 2, followed by the other two Kings.
This does not burn the pile - although four Kings have been played, they are not adjacent at the top of the play pile.
```

## 9. Showing 3s

3s are never _played_ like other cards, they are _shown_.

A player holding a 3 in their hand may choose to show it to another player as their action on their turn. This is performed as a physical gesture, holding the card out towards their chosen recipient, rather than playing it on the pile.

![Isildur showing a 3 to Sauron](/images/showing_a_three.png)\
_Isildur showing a 3 to Sauron during a particularly spicy game of Shithead_

The recipient of the 3 must pick up the play pile. The player to their left then takes the next turn. For this reason, it is common to show 3s to the player to your right, so that you then take the next turn as well.

If a player is shown a 3, but they also have a 3 in their hand, they may respond to the 3 with their 3, forcing the original player to pick-up instead (a "backfire"). In the rare case that the original player held a second 3, they could show that back to the second player, and so on.

3s are single-use and are always burned afterwards.

If a player has recently left the game by exhausting all their cards, they can be "shown" back into the game by a 3 so long as play has not gone a full rotation since their exit. So once the player who was to their right has completed their next turn, then there is no further danger of being shown back in.

A player holding a 3 in their hand may always show it on their turn - there is no scenario (e.g. a particular card on top of the play pile) that would prohibit them from showing their 3.

## 10. Endgame - "up" cards

Once a player has exhausted their hand-cards, and the pick-up pile is empty so there is no chance of replenishing their hand, then they can begin to play their up-cards.

At the point of their next turn, one of the up-cards of the player's choosing enters their hand, whether it is possible for them to play it this turn or not.

If the player has multiple up-cards of the same face value, they may choose to take some or all of these into their hand at once.

Once up-cards have entered the player's hand, the player takes a standard turn.

When a player plays their last hand-card(s), if they have an up-card (or multiple) with the same face value as the card(s) just played, those cards may also be played that turn (e.g. a jack in the hand and a jack up-card could be played as a pair). This is only permitted once the pick-up pile has been depleted.

If a player has an empty hand, with a 3 as an up-card, and is shown a 3 by another player, then they may bring the up-card into their hand at this point in order to show a 3 in response.

## 11. Endgame - "down" cards

Once a player has exhausted both their hand-cards and up-cards, they must play one of their down-cards blindly, since they do not know the value of any of these cards.

They may choose to pre-select and view this card prior to their next turn (once hand and up-cards are exhausted), at which point the card enters their hand. They may not change that decision once the card has been viewed.

If a player has no hand-cards, no up-cards, and has not pre-selected a down-card into their hand, and is shown a 3 by another player, they may take a down-card into their hand at this point. If it turns out to be a 3, they may show it in response to the 3 they were shown.

Since the down-card becomes a hand-card prior to being played, there is no need to reveal the card if it cannot be played on the player's next turn, it simply remains in the hand.

## 12. Libraries

An excessively large hand (e.g. 10+ cards) is a "library". If a player picks up a large amount of cards from the pile, giving them a library, all other players must sing "Library Boy" at this player, to the tune of ["Wonderboy" by Tenacious D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL4HSiGvk68&ab_channel=tenaciousDVEVO).

A player with a library will often request patience from the other players while they "sort out their library". These requests are not to be granted.

## 13. Losing thrice in a sitting

If a player loses three games in a sitting (consecutive or otherwise), all other players must sing "Once, Twice, Three Times A Shithead", to the tune of ["Three Times A Lady" by The Commodores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qTPVS1uiQ0&ab_channel=Commodores-Topic).
